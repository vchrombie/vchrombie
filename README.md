### Hi there 👋

I'm Venu. I love building tools that make boring tasks easy.

📊 I’m currently working on [GrimoireLab and it's components](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab).

📫 How to reach me: I live on the internet [@vchrombie](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=vchrombie).

😄 Fun fact: Snorlax's typical day consists of nothing more than :doughnut: eating and :zzz: sleeping.
