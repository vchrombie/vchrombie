### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Venu. I love building tools that make boring tasks easy.

ðŸ“Š Iâ€™m currently working on [GrimoireLab and it's components](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab).

ðŸ“« How to reach me: I live on the internet [@vchrombie](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=vchrombie).

ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: Snorlax's typical day consists of nothing more than :doughnut: eating and :zzz: sleeping.
